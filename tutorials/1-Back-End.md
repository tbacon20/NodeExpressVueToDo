# Back End

We previously introduced Node in the [Learning Node and Express](https://github.com/BYU-CS-260/learning-node-express) activity. You should use the same setup.

## If you are using nvm

 If you setup Node using nvm, then you need to first tell nvm which version of node to use:

```
nvm use stable
```

## Initialize a new Node project

The first step with node is to initialize a new project:

```
cd back-end
npm init
```

This will ask you a number of questions. Here is how I answered them:

```
package name: (node-express-vue-todo)
version: (1.0.0)
description: todo list
entry point: (script.js) server.js
test command:
git repository:
keywords:
author:
license: (ISC)
```
**Be sure to make the entry point server.js**

Now you need to install Express, which makes it easy to create a REST API, and
body-parser, which makes it easy to parse incoming requests. This will
automatically save these packages as dependencies in `package.json`:

```
npm install express body-parser
```

**Tip**: when putting code into a repository that uses node.js, be sure to create a file called
  `.gitignore` in the **top level** of your repository that contains:

```
node_modules
```

In this exercise, I have already placed a `.gitignore` into the repo for you.

## Setup

We'll start with a basic setup for a back end server. In `server.js`, put the following:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const app = express();

// parse application/x-www-form-urlencoded
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({
  extended: false
}));

// parse application/json
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server listening on port 3000!'));
```

This is the boilerplate we'll use for a Node and Express back end. We first load
the modules we need. Then we create an Express app and we configure the body
parser library so that it will parse forms and JSON requests.

We start the server on port 3000.

## Creating and reading items

Remember that on the back end a REST API will support CRUD operations -- Create, Read, Update, and Delete. We will start by doing the create and read operations.

Add the following before the `app.listen()` line in `server.js`:

```javascript
let items = [];
let id = 0;
```

Since we don't have a database yet, we will store the items in an array. This
means we can store state as long as the back end is running, but once it is
killed and restarted, we'll lose everything. This is better than what we have
been doing so far (where reloading the web page lost all the data), but we'll
add a database in subsequent exercises so we can store our data permanently.

Now let's do the create operation:

```javascript
app.post('/api/items', (req, res) => {
  id = id + 1;
  let item = {
    id: id,
    text: req.body.text,
    completed: req.body.completed
  };
  items.push(item);
  res.send(item);
});
```

We support requests to create a todo list item by accepting a POST request on
`/api/items`. This request should send two fields: `text` and `completed`. We'll
also add an `id` field, which we will increment each time a new item is added.
This will let us edit items by specifying the item `id`.

Creating a new item in the todo list is as simple as creating a new object and
then pushing it onto the array. We send back a 200 OK  with the created item in
the body of the response. The item will get converted to JSON.

Note, for now, our API has one shared todo list for everyone, and *anyone* can
create new items. Once we show you how to support authentication, we will have
one list per user and users will only be able to access their own list.

Next, we'll support the read operation:

```javascript
app.get('/api/items', (req, res) => {
  res.send(items);
});
```

This is pretty simple. We just send the entire array in a response. It will get converted into JSON, with a 200 OK response code.

Let's test it! In one terminal:

```
node server.js
```

In another terminal:

```
curl -X POST -d '{"text":"get an A on the exam", "completed":false}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:3000/api/items
curl -X POST -d '{"text":"party all night", "completed":false}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:3000/api/items
curl -X GET localhost:3000/api/items
```

## Updating items

To support editing items (which is what we're doing when we mark one as complete), add the following method to `server.js`:

```javascript
app.put('/api/items/:id', (req, res) => {
  let id = parseInt(req.params.id);
  let itemsMap = items.map(item => {
    return item.id;
  });
  let index = itemsMap.indexOf(id);
  if (index === -1) {
    res.status(404)
      .send("Sorry, that item doesn't exist");
    return;
  }
  let item = items[index];
  item.text = req.body.text;
  item.completed = req.body.completed;
  res.send(item);
});
```

In a REST API, we use a PUT request when we want to update an item. The URL will
include the item `id`, such as `/api/items/5` to edit item number 5. Node will
put this parameter into `req.params.id`.

We will *not* assume that the items are ordered in the `items` array by their
`id`. So to find an item with a given `id` we will create an `itemsMap`, which
is an array that contains just the item ids. We can then search through this
array using `indexOf`. Once we have the item we want, we use the `text` and
`completed` fields from `req.body` to change the item.

We return an error if the item isn't found. Like with other requests, we return
a 200 OK and send the item back.

Let's test it! In one terminal:

```
node server.js
```

In another terminal:

```
curl -X POST -d '{"text":"get an A on the exam", "completed":false}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:3000/api/items
curl -X POST -d '{"text":"party all night", "completed":false}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:3000/api/items
curl -X GET localhost:3000/api/items
curl -X PUT -d '{"text":"party all night", "completed":true}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:3000/api/items/2
curl -X GET localhost:3000/api/items
```

## Deleting items

To support deleting items, add the following method to `server.js`:

```javascript
app.delete('/api/items/:id', (req, res) => {
  let id = parseInt(req.params.id);
  let removeIndex = items.map(item => {
      return item.id;
    })
    .indexOf(id);
  if (removeIndex === -1) {
    res.status(404)
      .send("Sorry, that item doesn't exist");
    return;
  }
  items.splice(removeIndex, 1);
  res.sendStatus(200);
});
```

In a REST API, we use the DELETE method for deleting items. We again have the
`id` of the item in the URL, and we get it from `req.params.id`. Just like with
editing items, we can't assume the array is sorted by `id`, so we create a
second array that contains item `ids` and then search with `indexOf` to find the
item with the item we're looking for.

We return an error if the item isn't found. We return 200 OK if we are able to
delete the item.

Let's test it! In one terminal:

```
node server.js
```

In another terminal:

```
curl -X POST -d '{"text":"get an A on the exam", "completed":false}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:3000/api/items
curl -X POST -d '{"text":"party all night", "completed":false}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:3000/api/items
curl -X GET localhost:3000/api/items
curl -X DELETE localhost:3000/api/items/2
curl -X GET localhost:3000/api/items
```
